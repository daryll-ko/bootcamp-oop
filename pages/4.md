## Basic idea

```py
name = "Wilson"
kind = "walrus"
greeting = "Hi, Wilson the walrus!"

print(name)
print(kind)
print(greeting)
```

```
Wilson
walrus
Hi, Wilson the walrus!
```

What if we want another animal?

## Two animals

````md magic-move
```py
name = "Wilson"
kind = "walrus"
greeting = "Hi, Wilson the walrus!"

print(name)
print(kind)
print(greeting)
```

```py

greeting = "Hi, Wilson the walrus!"

print(name)
print(kind)
print(greeting)

name = "Kevin"
kind = "kangaroo"
greeting = "Hi, Kevin the kangaroo!"

print(name)
print(kind)

Can we get `Wilson` back?

## Two animals, but better

```py
name = "Wilson"
kind = "walrus"
greeting = "Hi, Wilson the walrus!"

print(name)
print(kind)
print(greeting)

name2 = "Kevin"
kind2 = "kangaroo"
greeting2 = "Hi, Kevin the kangaroo!"

print(name2)
print(kind2)
print(greeting2)

print(name)
print(kind)
print(greeting)
```
